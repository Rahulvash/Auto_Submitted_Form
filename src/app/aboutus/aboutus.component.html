<h1><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h1>
<p>
  If you’re in the process of writing or revising an “About Us” page, the way to start is by figuring out what makes your business unique. Is it your story? Your mission? Your employees?

  Visitors and customers aren’t going to be impressed by generic facts and figures, so it’s important that your page is not only accurate, but also sets you apart from the millions of other businesses online. And as the seven very different examples above demonstrate, there’s no “right” approach — so feel free to have a little fun with this part of your site!

  If you have any questions about creating an “About Us” page, or know of any other great examples, let me know in the comments below!
